# @stheine/pigpiod

Node.js interface for **pigpiod** on the Raspberry Pi Zero, 1, 2, or 3.

## Contents

## Features

## Installation

#### Step 1

This step can be skipped on Raspbian Jessie 2016-05-10 or newer as it includes the pigpio C library and pigpiod.

The pigpio package is based on the
[pigpio C library](https://github.com/joan2937/pigpio) so the C library needs to be installed first. Version V41 or higher of the pigpio C library is
required. It can be installed with the following commands:

```
wget abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/pigpio.zip
unzip pigpio.zip
cd PIGPIO
make
sudo make install
```

#### Step 2

```
npm install @stheine/pigpiod
```

I have developed and tested on Node.js 6.2.0, so it should be working ok here. It might very well work on the earlier versions of Node.js.

## Usage

```
const pigpiod = require('@stheine/pigpiod');

let pi  = pigpiod.pigpio_start();
let spi = pigpiod.spi_open(pi, 0); // SPI channel 0

// read A-D converter value on MCP3204 on SPI channel 0, MCP channel 0
const a2dValue = pigpiod.mcp3204(pi, spi, 0);
console.log(`a2dValue = ${a2dValue}`);

// DHT22 (this is a C-based implementation reading the sensor data)
dhtResult = pigpiod.dht22(pi, 18); // read DHT22 sensor on port 18
console.log(dhtResult);

pigpiod.spi_close(pi, spi);
pigpiod.pigpio_stop(pi);
```

## Standard pigpiod API

Following APIs are already implemented. See for details: http://abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/pdif2.html

Where not explicitly stated, the parameters are the same.

The error handling is different, though: Instead of returning an error code, an exception is thrown.

## API documentation

## Thanks

[pigpio library and pigpiod](http://abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/) Thanks to _joan2937_ for the development and documentation of the pigpio C library.

[pigpio](https://github.com/fivdi/pigpio) Thanks for _fivdi_ for his work on the pigpio module for Node.js. I used this as the base for my development and got additional development help.

# Breaking change

## 1.0.0

The `dht22` call has been switched to an asynchronous implementation, returning a promise.

## 2.0.0

I have to revert the changes released in 1.0.0, as the async `dht22` API works fine in a standalone example,
but causes intermittent process hangs in a project using additional API calls.
